Xml databinding for Java (xb4j)
-------------------------------

Yet another xml databinding framework? Yes. The following features are planned:
- use STaX for reading/writing xml
- configure by xml or programmatically
- Treat Java and xml as first class citizens
- Support for mapping Java classes to multiple xml schema namespaces

No binding configuration nor Java classfile generation is planned.
