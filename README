Xml binding for Java (xb4j)
---------------------------------

Yet another xml binding framework? Yes. And the following features are planned:
- use STaX for reading/writing xml
- Treat Java and xml as first class citizens
- Configure bindings programmatically (maybe even generate the bindings from schemas - in due time)
- Support for mapping Java classes to multiple xml schema namespaces

No Java class (neither source nor binary) generation is planned.
