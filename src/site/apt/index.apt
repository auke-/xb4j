Introduction

  The useradmin service implements a delegated user administration service. An administrator can add users and roles to the area
that he is responsible for and the changed configuration is passed on to the OpenAM Access and Identity Management (AIM) software package. 
It's functionality is comparable to the who-are-u service that was tailored towards the HP Select Access AIM software. OpenAM 
replaced HP Select Access in August 2012.
